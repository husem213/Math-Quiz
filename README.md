# Math-Quiz
This was my second project on C++ after the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
It is a math quiz where you can choose the number of quistions you want to answer, their difficulty level (easy, medium, hard, mixed), the operation type (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, mixed).
Then, you will start to answer the questions and the screen color will change according to the answer whether it is right or wrong.
If the answer is wrong, the right answer will be shown after.
At the end, you will find the whole results of the quiz.
